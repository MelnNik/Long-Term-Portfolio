# Long-Term-Portfolio
Project where I acquired data from FinViz, Polygon.io and TradingView in order to check stocks with a growth perspective using simple FinViz' filters.
Then I chose the best ones out of scanned stocks, compared companies with other companies from the same industry and committed a sentiment analysis and completed a portfolio allocation.
