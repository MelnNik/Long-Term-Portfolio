# Long-Term-Portfolio
Project where I acquired data from FinViz, Polygon.io and TradingView in order to check stocks with a growth perspective using simple FinViz' filters.
Then I chose the best ones out of scanned stocks, compared companies with other companies from the same industry and commited a sentiment analysis and completed a portfolio allocation. Used FinViz' scanner may show different tickers throughout the day, so the best way to use this notebook is to either run it multiple times or to play around with scanner's filters.
